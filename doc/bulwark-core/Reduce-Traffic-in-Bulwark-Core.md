# Reduce Traffic In Odex Core

Some node operators need to deal with bandwidth caps imposed by their ISPs.

By default, bitcoin-core allows up to 125 connections to different peers, 8 of
which are outbound. You can therefore, have at most 117 inbound connections.

The default settings can result in relatively significant traffic consumption.

Ways to reduce traffic:

## 1. Use -maxuploadtarget

A major component of the traffic is caused by serving historic blocks to other nodes
during the initial blocks download phase (syncing up a new node).
The option `-maxuploadtarget=<MiB per day>` can be specified in MiB per day and
is turned off by default. This is *not* a hard limit; only a threshold to minimize
the outbound traffic. When the limit is about to be reached, the uploaded data is
cut by no longer serving historic blocks (blocks older than one week).
Keep in mind that new nodes require other nodes that are willing to serve
historic blocks.

Whitelisted peers will never be disconnected, although their traffic counts for
calculating the target.

## 2. Disable "listening"

Disabling listening with -listen=0` will result in fewer nodes connected (remember
the maximum of 8 outbound peers). Fewer nodes will result in less traffic usage as
you are relaying blocks and transactions to fewer nodes.

## 3. Reduce maximum connections

Reducing the maximum connected nodes to a minimum with `-maxconnections=<num>`
could be desirable if traffic limits are tiny. Keep in mind that bitcoin's trustless
model works best if you are connected to a handful of nodes.
