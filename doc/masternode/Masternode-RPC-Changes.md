#Masternode RPC Changes

In order to maintain compatibility with future updates, RPC Masternode commands have been changed and converted to a JSON output.  This will overall positively affect ecosystem development with a more standard, parseable API.

## ```startmasternode```
- This command now handles all cases for starting a masternode instead of having multiple commands based on the context.
- Command arguments have changed slightly to allow the user to decide wither or not to re-lock the wallet after the command is run.
```text
startmasternode "local|all|many|missing|disabled|alias" lockwallet ( "alias" )

 Attempts to start one or more masternode(s)

Arguments:
1. set         (string, required) Specify which set of masternode(s) to start.
2. lockWallet  (boolean, required) Lock wallet after completion.
3. alias       (string) Masternode alias. Required if using 'alias' as the set.

Result: (for 'local' set):
"status"     (string) Masternode status message

Result: (for other sets):
{
  "overall": "xxxx",     (string) Overall status message
  "detail": [
    {
      "node": "xxxx",    (string) Node name or alias
      "result": "xxxx",  (string) 'success' or 'failed'
      "error": "xxxx"    (string) Error message, if failed
    }
    ,...
  ]
}
```
### Examples
`odex-cli masternodestart "alias" "my_mn"`
`curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "masternodestart", "params": ["alias" "my_mn"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:52541/`

## ```preparebudget``` and ```submitbudget``` commands
- Due to the requirement of maintaining backwards compatibility with the legacy command, these two new commands are created to handle the preparation/submission of budget proposals.
- Future intention is to roll these two commands back into a single command to reduce code-duplication. Parameter arguments currently remain unchanged from the legacy command equivalent.

## ```mnbudgetvote``` command
- This command now handles all cases for submitting MN votes on a budget proposal.
- Backwards compatibility with the legacy command(s) has been retained, with the exception of the `vote-alias` case due to a conflict in paramater type casting.
- A user running `mnbudget vote-alias` will be instructed to instead use the new `mnvote` command.
```text
mnvote "local|many|alias" "votehash" "yes|no" ( "alias" )

Vote on a budget proposal

Arguments:
1. "mode"      (string, required) The voting mode. 'local' for voting directly from a masternode, 'many' for voting with a MN controller and casting the same vote for each MN, 'alias' for voting with a MN controller and casting a vote for a single MN
2. "votehash"  (string, required) The vote hash for the proposal
3. "votecast"  (string, required) Your vote. 'yes' to vote for the proposal, 'no' to vote against
4. "alias"     (string, required for 'alias' mode) The MN alias to cast a vote for.
```

Result:
```text
{
  "overall": "xxxx",      (string) The overall status message for the vote cast
  "detail": [
    {
      "node": "xxxx",      (string) 'local' or the MN alias
      "result": "xxxx",    (string) Either 'Success' or 'Failed'
      "error": "xxxx",     (string) Error message, if vote failed
    }
    ,...
  ]
}
```

### Examples
`odex-cli mnvote "local" "ed2f83cedee59a91406f5f47ec4d60bf5a7f9ee6293913c82976bd2d3a658041" "yes"`
`curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "mnvote", "params": ["local" "ed2f83cedee59a91406f5f47ec4d60bf5a7f9ee6293913c82976bd2d3a658041" "yes"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:52541/`

## ```getbudgetinfo``` command
- This command now combines the old `mnbudget show` and `mnbudget getinfo` commands to reduce code duplication while still maintaining backwards compatibility with the legacy commands.
- Given no parameters, it returns the full list of budget proposals (`mnbudget show`).

```text
getbudgetinfo ( "proposal" )

Show current masternode budgets

Arguments:
1. "proposal"    (string, optional) Proposal name

Result:
[
  {
    "Name": "xxxx",               (string) Proposal Name
    "URL": "xxxx",                (string) Proposal URL
    "Hash": "xxxx",               (string) Proposal vote hash
    "FeeHash": "xxxx",            (string) Proposal fee hash
    "BlockStart": n,              (numeric) Proposal starting block
    "BlockEnd": n,                (numeric) Proposal ending block
    "TotalPaymentCount": n,       (numeric) Number of payments
    "RemainingPaymentCount": n,   (numeric) Number of remaining payments
    "PaymentAddress": "xxxx",     (string) Odex address of payment

    "Abstains": n,                (numeric) Number of abstains
    "TotalPayment": xxx.xxx,      (numeric) Total payment amount
    "MonthlyPayment": xxx.xxx,    (numeric) Monthly payment amount
    "IsEstablished": true|false,  (boolean) Established (true) or (false)
    "IsValid": true|false,        (boolean) Valid (true) or Invalid (false)
    "IsValidReason": "xxxx",      (string) Error message, if any
    "fValid": true|false,         (boolean) Valid (true) or Invalid (false)
  }
  ,...
]
```
### Examples
`odex-cli getbudgetprojection`
`curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getbudgetprojection", "params": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:52541/`

## Masternode network protocol layer reporting
The results from the `listmasternodes` and `getmasternodecount` commands now includes details about which network protocol layer is being used - IPv4, IPV6, or Tor.
